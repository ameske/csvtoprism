csvtoprism takes a CSV representation of the results from an assay and converts them to a format for Prism 6.

# Input Format

csvtoprism does not expect a rigid input format file. Rather it looks for 8 data lines and 8 identifier lines.

A data line has the following structure, where "A" - "H" represents the literal string "A" - "H" and Data Point is an integer.

```
<["A"-"H"]>,<Data Point>,<Data Point>,<Data Point>,<Data Point>,<Data Point>,<Data Point>,<Data Point>,<Data Point>,<Data Point>,<Data Point>,<Data Point>,<Data Point>
```

An identifier line has the following structure. There may be empty "cells" in the line. csvtoprism will discard those and grab the first 4 non-empty strings.

```
<["A"-"H"]>,<Identifier>,<Identifier>,<Identifier>,<Identifier>
```

# Output Format

Prism 6 takes in data in column format, where the identifiers are on the top row and the data associated with the identifiers are in columns.
